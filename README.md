# doge-planner

I'm learning C# for a project at work and the best way to learn is to play!

This will be an app written in C# using Microsoft VS Community 2017 and Xamarin.  My goals for this project are to learn about C#, the Visual Studio Community edditor and team use functionality, and to build my first Android app, using Xamarein.

The app will be a planner, event tracker, and note system for my partner and I to use for convenience, as well as I want to build something we will actually use.
